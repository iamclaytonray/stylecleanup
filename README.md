# Style Cleanup

_NOTICE: This is a fork that adds a couple features I (@iamclaytonray) wanted._

Wouldn't it be nice if you could automatically find & remove unused React
Native and Aphrodite style declarations?

`stylecleanup` is here to help!

```bash
$ yarn global add stylecleanup
# or
$ npm install -g stylecleanup
```

## Usage

```
Usage: stylecleanup [command] some/file/to/check.js
  command: one of 'check', 'fix', 'fix-force'
  globs are also supported, e.g.

  stylecleanup check './src/**/*.js'

  check: find & report missing & unused styles
  fix: remove all unused styles, but skip styles that *might* be used, but
    can't be verified because e.g. the stylesheet variable is passed around,
    or there's a computed property access. If you do 'styles[something]' it
    might be accessing anything, so we can't know for sure that apparently
    unused styles are actually unused.
  fix-force: remove all unnused styles, and all 'potentially' unused styles
```
